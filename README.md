# Background Story

Bangkok's Chao Phraya River is a major center of the city's development process. Starting from the transportation aspect, the division of several areas, to the residences in the range of its edge. Airbnb as one of the online marketplaces for lodging is one that has a number of listings in Bangkok. As Airbnb, of course, wants an increase in the number of existing listings to be up to 15% more than the previous year. In order to get a more in-depth analysis process and where the potential lies, a comparison process of listings alongside the Chao Phraya river with those that are not (other than) is carried out. Later it might be seen with the position of strategies to several landmarks from tourism, as well as public places (eg transportation), alongside the **Chao Phraya River** whether it has a number of interesting facts if the comparison is made. The end result will show the need for additional listing in which area.
